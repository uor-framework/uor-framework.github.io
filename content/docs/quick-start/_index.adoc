:sectnumlevels: 3

This guide provides an overview of the Universal Object Reference framework including everything that you need to get started from obtaining the necessary tooling to building, publishing and consuming content.

== What You Will Learn

* The UOR Client
* Introduction to Collections
* Interacting with a Collection
* User Defined Attributes

== Tools Required

The following tools are required in order to complete the steps illustrated in this guide:

* link:https://github.com/containers/skopeo[skopeo]
* link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/[jq]

== UOR Client

The primary method for interacting with UOR resources is by using the link:https://github.com/uor-framework/client/releases[Client]. This CLI based utility includes capabilities to support assembling, publishing, retrieval and discovery.

The Client can be installed from the link:https://github.com/uor-framework/client/releases[releases] page. Download the archive that corresponds with your operating system. Extract the archive and and add the binary to your `$PATH`.

Confirm the installation was successful by invoking the client:

[source, shell]
----
$ client version
----

Details related to the client will be presented if installation is successful.

Now that the client has been installed and configured, you are ready to start interacting with UOR content.

== Introduction to Collections

The primary purpose of the _client_ is to facilitate the interaction with _Collections_. A Collection is a set of content that is bundled together and stored as an OCI artifact. The individual resources within the artifact are decorated with additional metadata to enable filtering, discovery and retrieval. The following sections will discuss the lifecycle of a collection including mechanisms for interacting with the content. 

== Interacting with a Collection

Now that we know what a Collection refers to, let's begin working through the lifecycle of a collection by first assembling one.

=== Assembling a Collection

Any type of content can be represented by UOR. While the framework can be applied to a variety of use cases ranging from website content to AI model management, one of the most basic examples is managing a set of files on a file system. Files are given names, properties and organized into directories descending from a top level root. UOR makes use of similar paradigms. Content is added to a top level directory, known as a workspace. Their existence along with the relationship to other content is assembled by the client into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

To begin, first create a directory called `uor-workspace` which will contain the content UOR will manage and enter the newly created directory:

[source, shell]
----
$ mkdir uor-workspace
$ pushd uor-workspace
----

Now that a workspace is available, lets create a series of files for our file system use case. These files can be in any format, but let's create a mix of text files and jpeg photos.

Populate a file called `file1.txt` in the top level workspace directory with some sample content:

[source, shell]
----
$ echo 'Hawaiian Resources' > overview.txt
----

Next, create a directory called `content` which will contain two files: a text file containing a greeting along with a photo of a fish.

[source, shell]
----
$ mkdir content
$ cd content
$ echo 'aloha' > aloha.txt
$ curl -LsO https://github.com/uor-framework/client/raw/main/testdata/fish.jpg
$ popd
----

At this point, you should have three (files) in total as depicted by the output of the `tree` command below:

[source, shell]
----
$ tree uor-workspace

uor-workspace
├── content
│   ├── aloha.txt
│   └── fish.jpg
└── overview.txt

1 directory, 3 files
----

=== Publishing a Collection

With the desired set of files contained within the `uor-workspace` directory, the next step is to publishing a collection. This process performs three actions:

1. Discovers all content within the workspace
2. Produces an OCI artifact based on the content of the collection
3. Publishes the artifact to a remote repository.

To publish the collection to a remote registry, let's say that an instance of `registry:2` was running on our local machine and there is the desire to publish the collection to `localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:latest`.

Using the `push` subcommand, execute the following to publish the workspace to a remote registry. Additional options are also available for specifying the location of a file containing authentication details or communicating with an insecure or HTTP based registry if necessary. 

[source, shell]
----
$ client push uor-workspace localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:latest

WARN[0000] reference for unknown type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 
WARN[0000] reference for unknown type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 
WARN[0000] reference for unknown type: image/jpeg       
WARN[0000] reference for unknown type: application/vnd.uor.config.v1+json 
INFO[0000] Artifact sha256:43c520531d3c1f2dbebb82aaa1e55d19040075772bcdf44db32561eea73c76e9 published to localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:latest 
----

Do not be concerned about the `WARN` messages in the output of the _push_ execution. These are being emitted by the underlying link:https://oras.land[ORAS] library to client utilizes.

=== Exploring the Published Artifact

With the collection published, lets explore the contents of the OCI artifact that the client produced. There are a number of tools that can be used to investigate the composition of resources within an OCI registry. For readability, we will use `skopeo` and `jq`, however one could simply use `curl`` to produce the same results.

First, review the contents of the link:https://oras.land/cli/3_manifest_config/[manifest] to view each of the layers that were published. The `skopeo inspect` subcommand with the `--raw` flag will retrieve the contents of the manifest. The result can be piped to `jq` to improve the readability. Note, the `--tls-verify` flag also needs to be supplied in this instance as communication with the remote registry will utilize HTTP.  

[source, shell]
----
$ skopeo inspect --raw --tls-verify=false docker://localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:latest | jq

{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "config": {
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.uor.config.v1+json",
    "digest": "sha256:44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a",
    "size": 2
  },
  "layers": [
    {
      "mediaType": "image/jpeg",
      "digest": "sha256:2e30f6131ce2164ed5ef017845130727291417d60a1be6fad669bdc4473289cd",
      "size": 5536,
      "annotations": {
        "org.opencontainers.image.title": "content/fish.jpg"
      }
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
      "digest": "sha256:908784d6a78ecc1e08b63aa4af486eadba500caeeb131b6406ad1bd210099386",
      "size": 19,
      "annotations": {
        "org.opencontainers.image.title": "overview.txt"
      }
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
      "digest": "sha256:a79ec113dc7ece4dee24a5ffc967b4574c22270c99e9432773b63913ac62c95e",
      "size": 6,
      "annotations": {
        "org.opencontainers.image.title": "content/aloha.txt"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Reviewing the contents of the retrieved manifest, the UOR client published four (4) key items:

1. A link:https://oras.land/cli/3_manifest_config/[Manifest Config]
2. A layer for each of the assets contained within the workspace. 

Each item within the workspace becomes a layer within the artifact. By inspecting each layer, observe the properties that have been associated. For example, the picture of the fish:

[source, json]
----
{
    "mediaType": "image/jpeg",
    "digest": "sha256:2e30f6131ce2164ed5ef017845130727291417d60a1be6fad669bdc4473289cd",
    "size": 5536,
    "annotations": {
        "org.opencontainers.image.title": "content/fish.jpg"
    }
}
----

One can easily determine that the content contains a picture due to the _mediaType_ `image/jpeg`. In addition, the client also adds the relative location within the workspace to the `org.opencontainers.image.title` annotation of the layer representing the primary value for the content. This is used to reconstruct the assets as the artifact as a whole is retrieved. The topic of reassembly will be covered in the next section.

=== Retrieving a Collection

Just as easy as it was to publish a collection, a collection can be retrieved from a remote locations so that the contents can be reassembled locally. First, remove the existing `uor-workspace` directory locally if it still exists.

[source, shell]
----
$ rm -rf uor-workspace
----

Then, using the `pull` subcommand of the client, specify the reference of the artifact (collection) published to the registry previously along with the location locally the contents should be saved within. To recreate the previously deleted `uor-workspace` directory with the contents of the collection, execute the following command:

[source, shell]
----
$ client pull localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:latest uor-workspace

INFO[0000] Artifact sha256:43c520531d3c1f2dbebb82aaa1e55d19040075772bcdf44db32561eea73c76e9 from localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:latest pulled to uor-workspace 
----

Once again execute the `tree` command to verify the `uor-workspace` contains the expected contents: 

[source, shell]
----
$ tree uor-workspace

uor-workspace
├── content
│   ├── aloha.txt
│   └── fish.jpg
└── overview.txt

1 directory, 3 files
----

As illustrated by the response, the collection successfully reassembled the contents of the `uor-workspace` directory. This was once again all made possible because of the _annotation_ within each layer of the artifact. In the next section, we will extend this concept of using metadata contains within an object to enable additional means of classifying resources.

== User Defined Attributes

By default, the UOR client attaches an annotation to each resource within a collection to associate the relative location of the content within a workspace using the key `org.opencontainers.image.title`. This annotation is one of the well know link:https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md[Predefined Keys] as defined by the Open Container Initiative.

One of the key features of UOR is the ability to _reference_ content (hence the name Universal Object Reference) amongst a variety of different content types. This is accomplished, you guessed it, through attributes associated to each piece of content, and in this case, annotations on the layer. Aside from the default values that is produced by the UOR client, end users have the ability to define their own sets of attributes. This is accomplished using a `DataSetConfiguration`.

A `DataSetConfiguration` allows for a set of attributes to be associated with one or more resources within a collection and is represented in the following format:

.DataSetConfiguration Schema
[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: client.uor-framework.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataSetConfiguration
files:
  - file: <pattern>
    attributes:
      key: value
      key2: value2
----

A set of attributes can be associated to a given pattern of content and multiple declarations can be present within the `DataSetConfiguration`.

To demonstrate how a `DataSetConfiguration` can be used to transform the attributes of a collection, let's consider attributes that can be applied to the contents of the workspace contained in the `uor-workspace` directory.

In total, there are three files. Let's add a separate attribute to each file.

* `overview.txt` - 
* `content/aloha.txt` -
* `content/fish.jpg` -

Mapping the desired attributes to the resources in the collection results in the following set of content that would be included within the `files` property of a `DataSetConfiguration`:

[source, yaml]
----
...
- file: overview.txt
  attributes:
    series: Hawaiian
- file: content/aloha.txt
  attributes:
    classification: greeting
- file: content/fish.jpg
  attributes:
    animal: fish
...
----

In addition, let's add an attribute, `content: 'true'`, to each of the files within the `content` directory. This can be achieved using a wildcard pattern that retrieves all files within the `content` directory of the workspace shown below:

[source, yaml]
----
...
- file: content/*
  attributes:
    content: 'true'
...
----

Putting it all together, to create a `DataSetConfiguration` resource in a file called `dataset-configuration.yaml`, execute the following:

[source, shell]
----
$ cat << EOF > dataset-configuration.yaml
apiVersion: client.uor-framework.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataSetConfiguration
files:
  - file: overview.txt
    attributes:
      series: Hawaiian
  - file: content/aloha.txt
    attributes:
      classification: greeting
  - file: content/fish.jpg
    attributes:
      animal: fish
  - file: content/*
    attributes:
      content: 'true'
EOF
----

Associating a `DataSetConfiguration` to a collection is achieved when pushing a workspace to a remote registry by specifying the `--dsconfig` flag and referencing the location of the resource.

=== Publishing a Collection With Attributes

Publish a new tag of the collection called `dsconfig` with the additional metadata associated to the content by executing the following command:

[source, shell]
----
$ client push --dsconfig=dataset-configuration.yaml uor-workspace localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:dsconfig

WARN[0000] reference for unknown type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 
WARN[0000] reference for unknown type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 
WARN[0000] reference for unknown type: image/jpeg       
WARN[0000] reference for unknown type: application/vnd.uor.config.v1+json 
INFO[0000] Artifact sha256:43c520531d3c1f2dbebb82aaa1e55d19040075772bcdf44db32561eea73c76e9 published to localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:latest 
----

Retrieve the manifest of the published artifact verify the attributes were added as annotations to the collection content as defined by the `DataSetConfiguration` resource.

[source, shell]
----
$ skopeo inspect --raw --tls-verify=false docker://localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:dsconfig | jq

{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "config": {
    "mediaType": "application/vnd.uor.config.v1+json",
    "digest": "sha256:44136fa355b3678a1146ad16f7e8649e94fb4fc21fe77e8310c060f61caaff8a",
    "size": 2
  },
  "layers": [
    {
      "mediaType": "image/jpeg",
      "digest": "sha256:2e30f6131ce2164ed5ef017845130727291417d60a1be6fad669bdc4473289cd",
      "size": 5536,
      "annotations": {
        "animal": "fish",
        "content": "true",
        "org.opencontainers.image.title": "content/fish.jpg"
      }
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
      "digest": "sha256:908784d6a78ecc1e08b63aa4af486eadba500caeeb131b6406ad1bd210099386",
      "size": 19,
      "annotations": {
        "org.opencontainers.image.title": "overview.txt",
        "series": "Hawaiian"
      }
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
      "digest": "sha256:a79ec113dc7ece4dee24a5ffc967b4574c22270c99e9432773b63913ac62c95e",
      "size": 6,
      "annotations": {
        "classification": "greeting",
        "content": "true",
        "org.opencontainers.image.title": "content/aloha.txt"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

Notice how each layer representing the collection content now has user defined attributes associated to them. In addition, the `fish.jpg` and `aloha.txt` resources that are contained in the `content` directory have the additional annotation `content: 'true'` as they matched the wildcard pattern as defined in the `DataSetConfiguration`. Defining attributes is easy and unlocks the various mays that you will be able to interact with the content.

=== Filtering Content by Attributes

Defining attributes within a collection enables the ability to restrict the content that is retrieved from a collection in a remote registry. The presence of the additional annotations does not change the default functionality of the `pull` subcommand within the client. However, it does provide the capability to specify the `--attributes` flag which allows for a set of key/value pairs to be defined which will attempt to match any of the annotation within the content. 

For example, within the previously published collection, instead of retrieving all three files, let's say that we are only concerned with assets that are classified as "content". Since the attribute `content: 'true'` was defined on the `fish.jpg` and `aloha.txt` files, we can filter out only those resources when retrieving the collection.

Execute the following command to _pull_ the collection containing only "content" and store the retrieved assets in a directory called `uor-workspace-filtered`

[source, shell]
----
$ client pull --attributes=content='true' localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:dsconfig uor-workspace-filtered
INFO[0000] Artifact sha256:bc94fe2c03d48e3deb2a736f9d4b9b61411d1070df844c10e6002196f099189d from localhost:5000/uor-framework/getting-started:dsconfig pulled to uor-workspace-filtered 
----

Using the `tree` command one final time, confirm that only the assets denoted by the annotation `content: 'true'` were retrieved.

[source, shell]
----
$ tree uor-workspace-filtered

uor-workspace-filtered/
└── content
    ├── aloha.txt
    └── fish.jpg

1 directory, 2 files 
----

For this occasion, only two files were retrieved with the file called `overview.txt` being omitted as it did not have the desired annotation present.

== Next Steps

Now that you have an understanding of how to interact with the UOR framework, here are some additional areas of investigation to explore:

* Explore the link:https://oras.land/[ORAS project]
* Publishing a variety of content types within a collection
* Retrieving contents from a collection by specifying multiple attributes
